Dependencies
============
Before installing the package, ensure that you have the following
dependencies installed:
1. Python 2.4.x (if you use a different version of Python, edit the
   values assigned to PYINC and PYLIB in the Makefile).
2. The CPAN module TAP::Harness (only if you intend to run tests).
   If necessary, edit the value assigned to TEST_LIBDIRS to point
   at the lib directory where this package is installed.
3. Guile 1.6.x (if you use a different version of Guile and encounter
   problems, let me know about this).

Basic Installation
==================
1. Gunzip and untar the archive file into a directory.
   You will see a subdirectory having name of the form pyguile-x.y.z.
2. `cd' into this subdirectory.
3. Type `make' to build the library file `libpyguile.so'.
4. Optionally, type `make check' to run the package's self tests.
5. Currently, there is no `make install'.
   You'll have to manually copy the library file `libpyguile.so' and
   the module definition file `pyguile.scm' to a location where they
   will be found by Guile.
   You can obtain the locations searched by Guile by invoking the
   command `(display %load-path)(newline)'.
