Roadmap for future PyGuile versions:

* Make PyGuile work with Python 2.7, Python 3, guile 1.8, and guile 2.0.

* Option for turning on/off verbosity.
  Infrastructure: DONE
  Modules: DONE (except for two functions in pytoguile.c)
  Testing: partially done

* Allow Python objects (PyObject *) to own Guile objects (SCM).
  Function objects: DONE
  Objects with attributes: not done (implemented but not tested)

* Allow Python code to invoke Guile functions.
  DONE.

* Macros which will allow Python code to be invoked from Guile without
  special keywords or data formats.  Introspection of imported Python
  modules to allow Guile to recognize Python code without having to do
  anything special.
  - Also, natural way to set/fetch values of Python variables.

* Support for lazy conversion between heavy Python and Guile values

Roadmap for the build process:

* libtool/Autoconf/Automake

* Deb packaging auxiliary files

* RPM packaging auxiliary files

Roadmap for other similar libraries:

* Support for invoking Perl code from Guile.

* Support for other Scheme implementations.
